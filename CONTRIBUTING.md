# How to contribute

We founded our company to bring modern, agile ways of working to a broader
diversity of teams. We believe to make differentiated products, you’ve got to be
a different kind of company. That’s one reason why we're developing Action
as free open-source from its inception.

Shortly after we began, we announced a program we called “Equity for
Effort” to entice developers outside of our organization to contribute to
the creation of our application in exchange for the possibility of
equity in our company.

You can read our latest blog post on our
[Equity for Effort program here](https://medium.com/parabol-focus/equity-for-effort-v2-0-7ca93e0a3968#.y9upisjz4).

To get started, simply follow these steps:

   1. **Find a project:** review the “Help Requested” list on GitHub projects
   and find a mission you’d like to work on

   2. **Bid on it:** move the project to the “Bid” stage and leave a comment
   saying how many points you’ll do the project for
   (see: [Points and sizes](#points-and-sizes)) – if a mission is unclear, you
   can ask for more clarification at this stage

   3. **Do it:** Once we’ve accepted your bid, we’ll move the mission to the
   “Building” stage; then, go ahead and perform the work. Once you’re done,
   submit a pull request and move the project to the “Reviewing” stage.

   4. **Collect points:** After the work has been reviewed and merged into the
   source tree, we’ll update our public scoreboard and credit the creator(s)
   with the agreed upon number of points. Once an individual accrues more than
   100 points, if they’re qualified (of age, legally able, etc.), we issue them options for equity in Parabol, Inc.

# Compensation

For giving us a hand and helping the broader Action community, your
qualifying contributions may be converted into equity in Parabol Inc. Here’s
how it works:

1. When an issue is merged into the
   [Parabol Inc Action Repository](https://github.com/ParabolInc/action) by
   one of the project maintainers, we’ll tally up the points for your work.

2. We’ll add a row to the
   [Parabol Action Contributors Scoreboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V1KZJn6oKFsqrYwqr430rO3hkIkekSY7oYFzX3cVty4).
   If you’re working as a team, we’ll divide the points among you equally
   unless your team has requested an alternate distribution in the issue
   comments.

3. Once you’ve accumulated more than 100 points, we'll put an Options Grant
   proposal before our Board of Directors to convert your points to options
   in Parabol Inc. (see: [Conversion rate](#conversion-rate)) and issue
   these options to you (subject to board approval). The vesting clock
   will be backdated to the date we received a signature on the consulting
   contract for your first mission.

## Points and sizes

Before you begin working on an issue, you size it. Most issues will have a
*SWAG* sizing from one of the Action maintainers, but it’s up to you to
adjust it to what you think is fair.

|  Points  | Individual *or* team effort required |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ |
|    11    | Less than a single day               |
|    12    | One or two days                      |
|    13    | Three or four days                   |
|    15    | Five to seven days                   |
|    18    | Less than two weeks                  |
|    23    | Two to three weeks                   |
|    30    | Three to four weeks                  |
|    50    | Four to eight weeks                  |
|    110   | Too big! Let’s break it down…        |

## Conversion rate

At present, 100 points convert to options for 10,000 shares in Parabol Inc.
With 10,000,000 shares outstanding, that’s 0.1% of the company.

We'll convert for you every time you hit a new 100 point threshold. That is
to say, 200 points, 300 points, and so on.

We currently will reevaluate this conversion rate once per calendar quarter
at our board meeting.
