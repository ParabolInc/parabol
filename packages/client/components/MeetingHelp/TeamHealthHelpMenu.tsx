      Start by encouraging your team members to vote if they haven't already. Not sure what to say?
      Try this:
    </HelpMenuCopy>
    <HelpMenuCopy>
      "Hi everyone! Let’s take a moment to share feedback about how we’re all feeling. The results
      will be anonymized when we reveal them.”
    </HelpMenuCopy>
  </>
)

const AllGood = () => (
  <>
    <HelpMenuCopy>
      Begin by expressing your gratitude for the positive feedback. You can say something like:
    </HelpMenuCopy>
    <HelpMenuCopy>
      "Splendid! It's wonderful to see such a positive response from all of you."
    </HelpMenuCopy>
    <HelpMenuCopy>
      Continue the conversation by asking what everyone’s recent highlight was or why they voted
      positively.
    </HelpMenuCopy>
  </>
)

const MostlyNeutral = () => (
  <>
    <HelpMenuCopy>
      Start by acknowledging the feedback and ask what we can learn from it. Try saying:
    </HelpMenuCopy>
    <HelpMenuCopy>
      "Thank you for sharing your feedback. It seems like we have a mix of neutral responses, and
      that's okay. Let's use this opportunity to dive deeper and explore the reasons for that during
      our meeting.”
    </HelpMenuCopy>
  </>
)

const MostlyNegative = () => (
  <>
    <HelpMenuCopy>
      Try thanking your team for their honesty and validate their feelings. Address concerns with
      empathy and provide a supportive environment for open discussion. You can start by saying:
    </HelpMenuCopy>
    <HelpMenuCopy>
      "I appreciate everyone's honesty, even when it's not all positive. Let’s discuss these
      feelings during our meeting.”
    </HelpMenuCopy>
  </>
)

const VeryMixed = () => (
  <>
    <HelpMenuCopy>
      Thank participants and acknowledge the diversity of opinions. Start the conversation by
      saying:
    </HelpMenuCopy>
    <HelpMenuCopy>
      "It's interesting to see such a range of responses. Each perspective is valuable. Let's
      discuss the reasons for these results in our meeting and identify any patterns or common
      themes that emerge.”
