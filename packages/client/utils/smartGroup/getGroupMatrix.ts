/*
 * Use hierarchical agglomerative clustering to group the reflections by theme
 * Since a group can have more than 2 cards, simpler techniques (e.g. blossom algorithm) are insufficient
 * because they only solve assignment problems.
 * a HAC is O(n^3), but has the following benefits over other clustering techniques:
 *  - No need to specific the number of cluster (e.g. k-means clustering)
 *  - Provides a distance between clusters, which serves as a threshold
 *  - Accepts any distance function (euclidean performs better than cosine on small datasets)
 *  - Returns a binary tree making it easy to establish a maximum group size
 *
 * Traverses the binary tree until the branch is found that is under the threshold
 * if the number of leaves is > MAX_GROUP_SIZE, go down a level & repeat, else commit to result array
 * Returns an array where each child represents a reflection group
 * Each child of the reflection group is the distinct distance vector for a reflection
