/*
 * Code is loaded via lazy components, which has a nice fallback.
 * When data is loading, it cannot use the same fallback.
 * Sometimes, it's nice to show a single spinner until code + data has loaded.
 * By determining how long it took the code to load, we can start the animation
 * where it left off, making it look seamless.
