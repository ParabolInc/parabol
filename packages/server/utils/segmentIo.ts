     * a user new to Parabol visits our marketing website the Segment-generated
     * anonymousId is hashed to create the GA User ID. Before this change,
     * we assumed sending a identify() event that would tie the new, Parabol userId to the
     * anonymousId, but Google Analytics apparently does not support tying users together
     * in this way. When we would looked at our data, events coming from our app would
     * be tallied as "direct" rather than acquired through a known channel (e.g.
     * "Organic Search"), making it look like all these new users just dropped out of the
     * sky.
     *
     * To work around this, we specify which a UUID Segment will consistently hash
     * between our marketing site and app domains. We do this by passing in
     * additional Segment context, as seen here:
