    This is a friendly note to let you know that ${orgName} has officially reached ${Threshold.MAX_STARTER_TIER_TEAMS} active teams on Parabol - congrats! We love to see organizations finding value in Parabol and improving their teams in the process.

    As a reminder: Parabol's Starter Plan has a limit of two teams. Please upgrade your account to continue using Parabol with all of your teams: ${billingURL}

    If you arenâ€™t ready to upgrade, then in ${Threshold.STARTER_TIER_LOCK_AFTER_DAYS} days your account will revert to the two teams allowed on the Starter Plan. Feel free to contact us with any questions - weâ€™re here to help!

    sevenDayWarning: `Hi ${preferredName} ðŸ‘‹

    This is a follow-up notification to remind you that ${orgName}'s Parabol account is at risk of deactivation because youâ€™ve exceeded the two team limit on your Starter Plan.

    Once your account is deactivated, you will lose access to your teams and wonâ€™t be able to run Retrospective, Sprint Poker or Standup meetings with Parabol.

    You'll need to upgrade your account within the next ${Threshold.FINAL_WARNING_DAYS_BEFORE_LOCK} days to avoid losing access to your agile meetings: ${billingURL}

    If you arenâ€™t able to upgrade, we'll automatically deactivate the teams over the limit. If you have any questions, or if you'd like to discuss enterprise plans, feel free to contact us - we're happy to help make this process as smooth as possible.

    locked: `Hi ${preferredName} ðŸ‘‹

    Unfortunately, ${orgName} has exceeded the two-team limit on the Starter Plan for more than ${Threshold.STARTER_TIER_LOCK_AFTER_DAYS} days, and your account has been deactivated.

    Your teams will not be able to run meetings with Parabol, add new teams to your account, or access previous teams.

    You can re-activate your teams by upgrading your account: ${billingURL}

    If you have any questions, or if you'd like to discuss enterprise plans, feel free to contact us â€” weâ€™re here to help.
