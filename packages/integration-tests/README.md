# Integration Tests

These integration tests are written using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

## Writing a New Test

To write a new test, check out the [Getting Started documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) on the Playwright
site.

## Running the Test Suites

1. Start the dev server according to the main [README instructions](/README.md#installation)
2. In this directory, run `yarn test`.

## Debugging a Test

Playwright supports several options to interactively debug a test.
