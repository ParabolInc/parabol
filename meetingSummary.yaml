        interesting data on sales led vs organic Team Plan conversions in this

        TLDR: 

        All time: 56.11% sales led vs 43.89% organic

        This is probably skewed from historical changes to our HubSpot
        pipelines, meaning we aren't accurately identify "sales-led" deals in
        the past

        Last 12 months: 60.9% sales led vs 39.1% organic

        Last 6 months: 61.7% sales led vs 38.3% organic

        Last 3 months: 61.3% sales led vs 38.6% organic

        be a boosting factor for org growth, yet we are comparing number of
        users added between control vs. experiment groups.

        The release process is simple enough. No need to improve it more. If we
        are not able to fix the merge conflict when merging the PRs to the
        branch production, just drop that last part and use Gitlab pipeline to
        release to prod. Simple and no more work to do.

  comments:

        Even a partial migration would:

        - Reduce our  risk. Backups and restorations would be faster, smaller
        and everything in PG can be restored using Point In-Time Recovery.

        - Saving üí∏ in the cloud, being able to reduce the RethinkDB instance to
        a smaller one.


        A full migration out of RethinkDB should:

        - Reduce around 15% of GCP cost per environment ($376.07264 $/month per
        env => 2 envs => 752 $/month)

        - Make our backups consistent and reduce our time to make them to
        virtually nothing.

        - Probably helping PubSec projects, simplifying the stack and removing
        the unmaintained component.

        - Allow us to automatically deploy PPMIs: running databases in container
        would be possible in a safe enough way. That would allow us to build
        something to sell cheap and easy to deploy and maintain PPMIs
        "automatically".
