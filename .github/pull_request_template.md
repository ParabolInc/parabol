## Final checklist

- [ ] I checked the [code review guidelines](../../docs/codeReview.md)
- [ ] I have performed a self-review of my code, the same way I'd do it for any other team member
- [ ] I have tested all cases I listed in the testing scenarios and I haven't found any issues or regressions
- [ ] Whenever I took a non-obvious choice I added a comment explaining why I did it this way
- [ ] I added the label `One Review Required` if the PR introduces only minor changes, does not contain any architectural changes or does not introduce any new patterns and I think one review is sufficient'
- [ ] PR title is human readable and could be used in changelog
